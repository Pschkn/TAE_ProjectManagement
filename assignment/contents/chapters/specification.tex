The following chapter describes the specification of the developed system. It isbased on the customer requirements and correspondence with the customer. Thischapter will be adjusted if requirements change, to provide clearance during thedevelopment process, as well as the maintenance process after releasing thesystem.\section{Project Scope}The system shall support a driver with taking his car out of a parking lot. Thesystem is designed to work with the cars of the customer. It should use sensors,build around the car, to take the car out of every parking position in the mostconvenient and safe way. The system should provide a graphical user interfacewithin the car display, to provide overview over the process of taking out thecar.\section{Supported Parking Positions}The two main parking positions shall be supported, as shown in the picturesbelow:\begin{figure}[h!]  \centering     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]     {res/spec/Hintereinander.PNG}     \captionsetup{justification=centering}  \caption{Parallel Parking}  \label{fig:project plan}\end{figure}\begin{figure}[h!]  \centering     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]     {res/spec/Nebeneinander.PNG}     \captionsetup{justification=centering}  \caption{Perpendicular Parking}  \label{fig:project plan}\end{figure}\FloatBarrierA car moved out of a lengthwise parking lot has to face the same direction asbefore being taken out, while a car taken out of a transversal parking lot ismoved $90^\circ$ clockwise when being taken out. Angled parking lots aretreated the same way as transversal parking lots, only the orientation of the car is notchanged by the whole $90^\circ$, but by a smaller amount. In all cases, thecars have to leave the parking lot entirely, and must not enter the opposite lane at anytime of the process.\section{Sensors}The system uses a number of sensors placed on and within the automobile. Theyare used to ensure a secure process of taking out the vehicle off the parking lot:\begin{itemize} \item	Speed Sensor \newline Acquire the current speed  \item Distance Sensor \newlineAcquire the distances between the vehicle and obstacles\end{itemize}\section{Required Controls}The parking system requires the control or a possibility to interact with anumber of car components to work properly and to its full potential:\begin{itemize}  \item Transmission control \newlineSwitch between forwards and reverse driving\item Engine control \newlineSet the desired car velocity\item Board computer control \newlineDisplay the user interface \item Brake control \newlineDecrease the velocity\item Steering control \newlineChange the vehicles direction\end{itemize}The board computer is not mandatory for the system to work, but highlyrecommended.\section{Obstacles}The parking assistance system shall be able to take obstacles into account.There are two kinds of obstacles we are facing when running the process oftaking out a car of a parking lot:\textbf{Static obstacles} \newlineStatic obstacles are not moving themselves. Their distance towards our vehiclecontrolled by the parking assistant system only changes by the movement of thevehicle itself. We do not have to predict where the obstacle might be positionedat some other point in time. Static obstacles are objects like:\begin{itemize}\item Parked cars\item Houses \item Walls\item Burgundy\item Trees  \end{itemize}\textbf{Dynamic obstacles} \newlineDynamic obstacles have a movement, or the potential to move during our processof taking out the car of a parking lot. Their distance to our vehicle can changewithout our car having any velocity. If there is any possibility, an obstaclemight interfere with our vehicle, or the predicted path of our vehicle, it hasto be taken into account during the process. If the distance between an obstacleand our vehicle is reducing by a higher ration than the velocity of the car, thecar has to stop. Dynamic obstacles are objects like:\begin{itemize}\item Moving cars\item Human beings\item Animals  \end{itemize}\section{Country Regulations}The system should primary work in Great Britain – thus the traffic rules ofBritain should be considered when running a process of taking the vehicle out ofthe parking lot. The rules for the process do not differ in any country ofEurope by any other factor than the side of the road the cars are driving on.Therefor there must be a setting to switch between:\begin{itemize} \item Right-hand traffic \item Left-hand traffic (default)  \end{itemize}\section{Graphical User Interface}The graphical user interface is a non-mandatory, but highly recommended part ofthe system. It shall initiate the process of taking a car out of its parkingposition. It shall be intuitive and use the corporate design of the customer.Furthermore, it shall monitor the process by displaying the followinginformation to the driver:\begin{itemize} \item	A top-down view of the car and the closest surroundings \item Predicted car route \item Vehicle velocity \item Driving direction \item Distance to the closest obstacles on each side of the car \item Warnings in case of dangerous situations  \end{itemize}\section{Implementation}The system should be implemented with the programming language C#. For thegraphical user interface the framework WPF is to be used, as well as thecorporate design of the customer for WPC controls styling. For sensorcommunication we will use CAN buses and extract the required information fromthe streams. An SQL database will be supplied to assure fast processing of thehigh amount of data in a small time and to ensure performance we will work withstored procedures.
